## Dissemination
### Myke Board
#### Materials
The Myke Board is a mycelium-based surfboard that seeks to replace the harmful materials in modern surfboards (polyurethane and expanded polystyrene) with more sustainable materials that are not harmful to the environment or to the shaper. The base substrate is made up of agricultural waste that is then joined together through a fungal strain known for its material properties. The result is a low-dense, hydrophobic material that can be shaped like a surfboard and has a similar performance. 

#### Audience
Surf schools, beginner surfers. People that are getting started in the sport are less picky about new materials that haven’t been thoroughly tested for performance.

#### Dissemination partners
The European Commission that supports innovation that tackles plastic pollution, environmentally mindful surf schools, design magazines and media.

#### Communication
The future of surfing is not in plastic, it’s in collaboration with the micro-organisms that surround us to create new tools to experience nature in a way that is beneficial to all stakeholders: users, micro-organisms, and the environment.

### Bioshoe & bio-wearables
#### Materials
The bio-shoe is a physical artifact which presents an alternative to material choices in traditional shoe production. The sole is shaped with mycelium which grows into a 3D-printed mold while the upper part consists of bioplastics. The shoe serves as an example of possibilities in a desired future which contains fewer non-renewable plastics and waste. Bio-wearables including jewelry, gloves, and accessories are made with bio-materials and grow-lay filament which are created to excite users during the event, help them engage more with an altered self while showing the possibilities of what can be made with biomaterials, and allow participants to have a playful, symbiotic relationship with material objects.
